    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <div class="instructions">
      <ol start="1">
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ground chicken, bread crumbs, chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped parsley,
        </li>
        <li>and salt. Mix everything together until well combined. You can also add additional spices or seasonings
          according </li>
        <li>to your taste preferences.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape them into burger patties. You can make them about 1/2 to
          3/4 inch</li>
        <li> thick, depending on your preference. Make sure the patties are evenly shaped for even cooking.</li>
        <li>Preheat a grill, stovetop grill pan, or a skillet over medium heat. If using a grill, make sure it is
          preheated to </li>
        <li>medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken patties onto the preheated grill or skillet. Cook the patties for about 5-6 minutes on
          each side,</li>
        <li> or until they are cooked through and reach an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). The cooking time may
          vary </li>
        <li>depending on the thickness of your patties.</li>
        <li>While the patties are cooking, you can prepare any additional toppings or condiments you'd like to serve
          with the </li>
        <li>chicken burgers. Slice some tomatoes, onions, lettuce, or any other toppings you prefer.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken patties are fully cooked, remove them from the heat and let them rest for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>This allows the juices to redistribute and makes the burgers juicier.</li>
        <li>Assemble your chicken burgers by placing the patties on burger buns or bread slices. Add your desired
          toppings </li>
        <li>and condiments, such as cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, or sauces like mayonnaise or barbecue
          sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken burgers while they are still warm. You can enjoy them with a side of fries, coleslaw,
        </li>
        <li>or a fresh salad.</li>
